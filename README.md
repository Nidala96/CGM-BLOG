The blog project, built using Java Spring Boot, encompasses a robust set of technologies to create a secure and efficient web application. The key components of the project include:

Spring Boot: The foundation of the project, providing a powerful and streamlined framework for developing Java-based applications. Its convention-over-configuration approach simplifies development and promotes rapid iteration.

Spring Security: Integrated to manage user authentication and authorization, ensuring secure access to the blog. Differentiated user roles are implemented using Spring Security, enhancing overall system security.

Hibernate: Employed for data persistence, Hibernate simplifies the interaction between the application and the MySQL database. The object-relational mapping (ORM) capabilities of Hibernate facilitate seamless data handling.

MySQL: The chosen relational database management system, used to persistently store blog data. MySQL, in conjunction with Hibernate, provides a reliable and scalable solution for data management.

JSON Web Token (JWT): Implemented for secure user authentication. JWTs serve as tokens for user verification, enhancing the overall security of the application. This approach allows for stateless authentication, improving scalability.

The blog itself incorporates features such as post creation and modification, along with the ability to add comments. The use of JWT ensures a secure authentication process for users with differentiated roles. The project's architecture follows the principles of microservices, contributing to modularization and ease of maintenance.

Development tools such as Maven are utilized for efficient dependency management, while Postman and Swagger facilitate comprehensive testing and debugging. Through the implementation of this blog project, valuable skills in Java Spring Boot, security practices, Hibernate, MySQL database management, and JWT authentication have been honed, providing a solid foundation for future web application development.
